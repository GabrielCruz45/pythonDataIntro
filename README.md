    This is my UM Introduction to Data Science with Python assignments, and trial-and-error scripts repository.
    This course is part of UMichigan's Applied Data Science with Python Specialization ——the first of six.

    Will be using LLM's help to create more exercises to practice the tools given in class.
    Also, will use other YouTube tutorials to help supplement the libraries given in the class —listed below.
